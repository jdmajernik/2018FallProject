#Shock Squads
This was a group project over the fall semester of 2018.
The concept behind it was to create a multiplayer shooter where you play as robots that can shoot off each other's limbs with the option to pick them up and use them yourself.
The game was developed in Unity between myself and another developer.
This was my second time using Git, so that was a fun learning curve during the development of this project.
