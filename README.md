# Shock Squads
2018 Fall Project - Unity 2018.0


The concept behind this project was to create a multiplayer shooter where you play as robots that can shoot off each other's limbs with the option to pick them up and use them yourself.
The game was developed in Unity between myself and another developer, with some other students volunteering to work on assets.

Many things stood in the way of this project's progress. For starters, everyone was working on it in their spare time. Additionally, none of us had much experience with networking in video games.

In addition, this was only my second time using Git ever, so there were some setbacks due to my inexperience.

In the end, I feel that this showcases my desire to always push myself to be better than I was before.

### Things I'm proud of
1. This was my first time using post-processing effects.
2. This was also my first time messing with GUIs to make them feel non-static. I'm pretty happy with how those turned out.

### Things I would have changed
1. There were a lot of learning curves on this one, which significantly slowed development. That being said, I would have structured the Repo better.
2. Looking back on it, most of the code is pretty messy. I definately would've cleaned it up and developed a more well-defined naming convention and organizational structure for classes/scripts.
